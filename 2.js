// Even Fibonacci numbers
// Problem 2
// Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

// 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

// By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

//answer

// generate fibonacci numbers upto 4 million

let fib = [1, 2];
for (let i = fib.length; i < 50; i++) {
  fib[i] = fib[i - 2] + fib[i - 1];
  if (fib[i] > 4 * 1000 * 1000) {
    fib.pop();
    break;
  }
}

// find all even numbers and sum them
this.answer = fib.filter(f => f % 2 === 0).reduce((a, c) => a + c);

console.log(this.answer); // 4613732
